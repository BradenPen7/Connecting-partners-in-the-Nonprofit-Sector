## This repository includes both the midterm and final of MG 403, as well as ideas we had for connecting our class partner, WE INC.

## This project is focused on connecting our class partner, Workshops Incoporated, with other organizations in the nonprofit sector. 

## The organizations must fit the criteria that compliment both parties, which shifted our focus to the collaboration between them and Disability Rights and Resources.

## Our main idea for Disability Rights and Resources was the ability to cross-reference clients between both organizations.

## Orginally we were tasked with one organization for midterms, but shifted our focus towards the marketing aspect of other organizations that compliment WE Inc. 

## This class was one of the most challenging, although in terms of technical skills not the hardest. 
## This was due to the amount of times we had to pivot and change our approach to the project. The organizations must align with WE INC's criteria-- that being most importantly mission but also capacity.  
## The most used skill here was critical thinking and the pairing of compromise between team members. Not all opinions were aligned. We also used TOWS, SWOT, and the financial analysis of both parties. 

## We recieved a grade letter of A for this project.
